        This site is generated by Wesley Mols as part of the individual project @Sogyo The Netherlands.
        This is the final project of the Sogyo academy for software engineers.
<b> My project is titled IPsportdata.</b> This application can take Maximal Lactate Steady State (MLSS) test data and return an estimaiton for anearobe threshold power. The goal is to analyse test results and give a race power advice (not yet implemented). Users should first perform a cycling test as described in the following protocol.

A protocol to find MLSS must be followed similar to the protocol on: https://www.highnorth.co.uk/articles/blood-lactate-testing-protocols-for-cyclists
It is recommended to perform this test on an ergometer and have some practice in taking lactate samples. 
Sample values can be entered in the specific boxes.<br/>
This results in the following business rules:<br/>
*  power data n corresponds with sample 1 and sample 2<br/>
*  if sample 2 - sample 1 is smaller than 1 then next input is expected, else a return statement shows power n and power n-1. <br/>
*  aerobe threshold is calculated by multiplying MLSS with 72%. <br/>
*  power to weight ratio is calculated on MLSS devided by the weight (watt/kg). <br/>

    Information about the user input fields
    </h2>
    <p>
      You must enter a username which is stored in the database to retrieve your data. <br/>
    You may enter your weigth. Please enter a number with up to 2 decimals inidcated by a dot. This way your watt/kg value for your FTP is calculated. <br/>
    We are working on the implementation of a calculator that estimates your cycling speed based on size. However, entering your length does not do anything yet. Please enter a whole number. 
    Please enter your data one row at the time, filling in all the boxes on the second row. <br/>
    Please enter power as a whole number. <br/>
    Please enter lactate as a decimal. <br/>
    Please enter heart rate as a whole number. <br/>
